# Rain-Fall-Prediction-
Introduction
This project is focused on predicting the likelihood of rainfall for the next day using machine learning techniques. The model is built using Gradient Boosting, a powerful ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners to improve accuracy and performance.

Project Overview
Predicting rainfall accurately is essential for various sectors such as agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. This project utilizes historical weather data, including features like temperature, humidity, and wind speed, to predict whether it will rain tomorrow.

Data
The dataset includes historical weather data, which has been preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables. This clean dataset is then used to train and test the machine learning model.

Methodology
Data Collection: Gathered historical weather data from reliable sources.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Selection: Identified the most relevant features for predicting rainfall.

Model Training: Applied Gradient Boosting to train the model on the training dataset.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction: Used the trained model to predict rainfall for the next day.

Conclusion
The Gradient Boosting model effectively predicts rainfall using historical weather data, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications. Future work may include optimizing the model further and incorporating additional weather features to enhance prediction accuracy.
